#### Description:

An application that allows users to organize their wardrobe, create new combinations and
import new clothes from shopping websites to see how they fit in to their existing wardrobe before finalising purchase.

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! If it is too short, the system will reject it.
